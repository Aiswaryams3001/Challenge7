            Jamshetji Nusserwanji Tata, founder of the Tata Group, opened the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower,

            the first Taj property and the first Taj hotel, on 16 December 1903. The building overlooks

            the Arabian Sea. He decided to open the grand luxury hotel after an incident involving racial

            discrimination at the Watson's Hotel in Mumbai, where he was refused entry as the hotel did not

            permit Indians, who were non-white. Hotels which accepted only European guests were then very

            common across British India. Jamsetji Tata travelled to London, Paris, Berlin and Düsseldorf to

            arrange for materials and pieces of art, furniture and interior artefacts for his hotel.

            The Taj Group has been active in converting former royal palaces in India into world class

            luxury hotels such as the Taj Lake Palace in Udaipur, the Rambagh Palace in Jaipur and Umaid

            Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur.
